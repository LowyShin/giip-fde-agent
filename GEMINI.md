# GEMINI Agent Rules

This file defines the global rules and behaviors for the GIIP Agent system. All agents (sub-sessions) must adhere to these guidelines.

## 📜 Core Principles
1.  **Strict Rule #1**: No raw SQL (`Invoke-Sqlcmd`). Use `mgmt/execSQLFile.ps1`.
2.  **Evidence First**: Always link technical evidence as markdown files.
3.  **Script Reuse**: Check `.agent/scripts/` and `giipdb/mgmt/scriptlist.md` before writing new scripts.

## 🏗️ React & Next.js Best Practices
Agents working on frontend code must follow the Vercel Engineering Best Practices defined in `.agent/rules/`.

- **Waterfalls**: Eliminate sequential awaits. Use `Promise.all` or `better-all`.
- **Bundle Size**: Avoid barrel file imports. Use dynamic imports for heavy components.
- **Server Actions**: Minimize serialization at RSC boundaries.
- **Data Fetching**: Use SWR for client-side caching and deduplication.
- **Rendering**: Optimize re-renders with proper composition and state management.

See [.agent/rules/](../.agent/rules/) for detailed guidelines.

## 🛠️ Workflow & Skills
Agents MUST use the specialized skills in `.agent/skills/` for complex engineering tasks to ensure quality and reliability.

1.  **Subagent Driven Development**: For implementing complex features, break down tasks and use the `subagent-driven-development` skill. This enforces a "Spec Review -> Code Review" pipeline.
2.  **Writing Plans**: Before writing code, ALWAYS create an implementation plan using the `writing-plans` skill.
3.  **Test Driven Development**: Follow the TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor) as defined in `test-driven-development` skill.
4.  **Systematic Debugging**: For tough bugs, use the `systematic-debugging` skill to find the root cause, not just patch symptoms.
